# **Global Development Data Analysis (2023)**
### **Exploring the Interplay Between Population, Economy, and Education**

## **Overview**
This project investigates the relationships between geodemographic, economic, and educational indicators across countries using **2023 data**. By analyzing key correlations, we aim to uncover **underlying factors influencing national development**, such as:
- The impact of **population size on economic output**
- The **environmental costs** of economic growth
- The role of **education in improving health outcomes**

The findings provide **data-driven insights** that can guide policymakers in fostering **sustainable development and global well-being**.

---

## **Project Structure**
The repository consists of:
- **Data Files (CSV)** - Raw data used for analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook (`Global Development Analysis.ipynb`)** - Code for cleaning, processing, and analyzing the data.
- **Final Report (`Global Development Analysis Report.pdf`)** - Written findings, visualizations, and recommendations.

---

## **Data Sources**
The project uses three primary datasets:

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| `Global Population 2023.csv` | Population data, birth rates, life expectancy, and demographics. |
| `Global_Education.csv` | Education statistics, including tertiary enrollment and literacy rates. |
| `world-data-2023.csv` | Economic indicators such as GDP, minimum wage, and CO₂ emissions. |

These datasets were **cleaned and merged** into a unified dataset for analysis.

---

## **Project Aims**
- **Identify key correlations** between population, economy, and education.
- **Visualize trends** using correlation matrices, scatter plots, and graphs.
- **Provide insights for policymakers** on sustainable development strategies.

---

## **Running the Analysis on Google Colab**
To execute the Jupyter Notebook and perform the analysis:

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload `Global Development Analysis.ipynb` and the **CSV data files**.
3. Run the cells to:
   - Load and clean the datasets.
   - Conduct correlation analysis.
   - Generate visualizations and summary statistics.

---

## **Key Findings**
Some of the major insights from the analysis include:
- **Population vs. GDP:** Countries with larger populations tend to have higher GDP, but outliers like the US and China show additional influencing factors.
- **Economic Growth vs. CO₂ Emissions:** There is a **strong correlation** between economic development and environmental impact, highlighting sustainability concerns.
- **Education vs. Health Outcomes:** Higher education enrollment is **linked to lower infant mortality rates**, emphasizing the role of education in public health.

For a detailed breakdown, refer to the **final report**: [`Global Development Analysis Report.pdf`](Global%20Development%20Analysis%20Report.pdf).

## **Data Analysis Tools**
This project utilizes various **Python libraries** and tools for data analysis, visualization, and statistical insights:

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive environment for running Python code.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, standardizing data, and merging datasets.
- **Statistical Analysis** – Correlation matrices and descriptive statistics for data interpretation.
- **Data Visualization** – Heatmaps, scatter plots, and graphs to illustrate trends and relationships.

---

## **Conclusion**
This study highlights the **complex interdependencies** between population, economic growth, and education. The findings can **inform policies** on sustainable growth, resource allocation, and social development.

For any questions or discussions, feel free to **open an issue** or contribute to the project!
